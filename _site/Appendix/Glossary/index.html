    <h1 id="calendaring-and-scheduling-glossary-of-terms">Calendaring and Scheduling Glossary of Terms</h1>

<p>This page is an effort to compile, in one location, a common set of terminology with respect to calendaring and scheduling applications and standards. The document incorporates terminology already existing in calendaring standards such as RFC5545 (Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar)), RFC5546 (iCalendar Transport-Independent Interoperability Protocol (iTIP)), RFC6047 (iCalendar Message-Based Interoperability Protocol (iMIP)), RFC4791 (Calendaring Extensions to WebDAV (CalDAV)), RFC6638 (Scheduling Extensions to CalDAV (CalDAV)), as well as input from members of the Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium (CalConnect).</p>

<p>Some glossary terms may not appear in published standards today. These are common calendaring terms that are included so that everyone refers to components in the same manner.</p>

<p>As new standards evolve, the glossary will serve as a resource for those creating documents so that all the standards share a common set of terms.</p>

<p>Calendaring and scheduling implementers will be able to utilize the glossary to assist them as they read and decipher calendaring standards. Calendaring and scheduling users will be able to use the glossary to help them better understand the terminology deployed by applications written using calendaring standards.</p>

<h5 id="access-control">Access Control</h5>
<p>Access control is a system which enables an authority (e.g., user or resource administrator) to control access to different entities in a calendar system. Typically vendors create Preference/Settings options to instantiate access control. Terminology varies considerably across products but broadly speaking access control is usually broken into two areas, read access and write access. Vendor terminology used for read access includes: ‘read’, ‘reviewer’, ‘proxy read’, ‘viewer’, ‘see all’, and ‘see only freebusy’. Vendor terminology for write access includes: ‘write’, ‘editor’, ‘proxy write’, ‘proxy’, ‘manager’, ‘administrator’, ‘designate’, ‘read/create/edit’, ‘make changes’, ‘manage’, and ‘edit’. (Cp. Delegate and Designate below.)</p>

<h5 id="access-control-list">Access Control List (ACL)</h5>
<p>A list of access control elements that define access control to a particular calendar system entity. (Reference: RFC3744 for its use in a WebDAV context.)</p>

<h5 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h5>
<p>Information pertaining to access to a resource by the physically disabled. This applies to Location Resources.</p>

<h5 id="admittance-info">Admittance Info</h5>
<p>All information required to gain access to a resource. It applies to Location Resources.</p>

<h5 id="agenda">Agenda</h5>
<p>See <a href="#calendar">Calendar</a>.</p>

<h5 id="alarm">Alarm</h5>
<p>Use of the terms alarm, reminder, alert, and notifications vary by implementation and can represent several things. They can represent a setting applied to an event by which a user indicates they want a ‘notification’ to be triggered to ‘remind’ them about some event or action (cp. VALARM in RFC5545). They can also be used to designate the type of ‘alert’ that serves as the notification (e.g., email message, audible sound, pop-up window). (Reference <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4791">RFC4791 (CalDAV)</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.6.6">RFC5545</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5546">RFC5546 (iTip)</a>.)</p>

<h5 id="caldav">CalDAV</h5>
<p>Extensions to the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) protocol to specify a standard way of accessing, managing and sharing calendar data based on the iCalendar format. Defined by two specifications, the first, RFC4791, specifies a calendar access protocol that allows Calendar User Agents to access and manage calendar data. The second specification, RFC 6638, specifies a standard way of performing scheduling transactions with iCalendar-based calendar components.

<h5 id="calendar-system">Calendar System</h5>
<p>A way to represent dates as a combination of eras, years, months, weeks, and days in formats used in many different parts of the world. A calendar system also defines the limits for those different quantities and how “date arithmetic” can be done to implement repeating dates. (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar for a description of many different calendar systems.)</p>

<h5 id="calconnect">CalConnect</h5>
<p>The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium is a non-for-profit partnership between vendors of calendaring and scheduling systems and tools, and users of those tools. Our purpose is to improve all aspects of calendaring and scheduling, in particular interoperability. We do this by improving existing standards, developing new standards, offering interoperability testing for calendaring and scheduling systems and tools, collaborating with other organizations with similar goals, and conducting periodic conferences where engineers and customers meet and interact in a collegial atmosphere. Although CalConnect is not a standards development organization, virtually every important calendaring or calendaring-related standard over the last five years has been authored, edited and/or coedited by members of a CalConnect Technical Committee.</p>

<h5 id="calscale">CALSCALE</h5>
<p>An iCalendar property used to identify the calendar system used to represent dates and times within an iCalendar object. iCalendar currently only defines the GREGORIAN calendar system.</p>

<h5 id="calws">CalWS</h5>
<p>CalWS-REST is a CalConnect Proposal and CalWS-SOAP will be a parallel CalConnect Proposal which define an API of basic operations which allow creation, retrieval, update and deletion of calendar objects.

<h5 id="counter">Counter</h5>
<p>A response sent by a Attendee of an event to the event Organizer to propose a change to the event or task such as the scheduled date/time, list of participants, etc. (Reference: RFC5546.)</p>

<h5 id="delegate">Delegate</h5>
<p>In common usage ‘delegate’ may mean either a person who acts for someone else (cp. Designate below) or refer to the act of appointing someone as a representative. The term has very specific meaning in the iCalendar and iTIP RFCs. In iCalendar, delegate means to specify that another individual, rather than oneself, should attend an event (cp. Delegator and Delegatee). In iTIP, delegate means to assign ownership of a task to another individual.

<h5 id="property">Property</h5>
<p>RFCs define the objects and components of their subject which in turn have properties which have values (sometimes referred to as ‘property parameters’ or ‘property attributes’). These “property parameters” contain meta-information about the property or the property value. Property parameters are provided to specify such information as the location of an alternate text representation for a property value, the language of a text property value, the value type of the property value, and other attributes. Throughout this glossary are references to component, property, and attribute following this usage. (Reference: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.8">RFC5545</a>.)</p>

<h5 id="request">Request</h5>
<p>A broadly used term in multiple RFCs to represent an action. That action may be a query for property values from a client to a server (cp. RFC4791), a query between a client and a server that results in object creation, modification, or deletion (cp. RFC4791 and RFC5545), and it is the name of a method in iTIP that makes “an explicit invitation to one or more attendees” (among other things, cp. RFC5546). (Reference: RFC4791, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5545#section-3.7.2">RFC5545</a>, RFC5546, and Internet Calendar Scheduling Protocol (iSchedule).)</p>

<h5 id="reminder">Reminder</h5>
<p>See Alarm.</p>

<h5 id="repeating">Repeating</h5>
<p>See Recurring.</p>

<h5 id="resource">Resource</h5>
<p>A resource in the scheduling context is any shared entity, that can be scheduled by a calendar user, but does not control its own attendance status. Resources can be of “Location”, “Equipment”, or “Role” type.</p>

<h5 id="resource-kind">Resource Kind</h5>
<p>Specifies the kind of resource object represented. Some of the possible values are “Location”, “Thing”, or “Group”. Location is used for any physical location resource such as room, building, etc. Thing is used for any physical object that can scheduled like projector, printer, etc. Group is used to specify a group of resources with a specific skill set. For example: drivers, electricians, etc.</p>

<h5 id="resource-manager-info">Resource Manager Info</h5>

<h5 id="subscribed-calendar">Subscribed Calendar</h5>
<p>A calendar that has been published, typically on an HTTP server. See Publish.</p>

<h5 id="task">Task</h5>

<h5 id="text-calendar">Text/calendar</h5>
<p>The MIME content type for encoding iCalendar objects. Example usage includes: email, web pages.</p>

<h5 id="timezone">Timezone also Time Zone</h5>
<p>Areas of the Earth that have adopted the same local time. Time zones are generally centered on meridians of a longitude, that is a multiple of 15, thus making neighboring time zones one hour apart. However, the one hour separation is not universal and the shapes of time zones can be quite irregular because they usually follow the boundaries of states, countries or other administrative areas. In RFC5545, time zones are represented using “VTIMEZONE” calendar components, each with a Time Zone Identifier (TZID) that can be used to tie a particular date and time to a specific timezone.</p>

<h5 id="timezone-service">Timezone Service</h5>
<p>A client/server protocol used for distributing Timezone data. The protocol improves the accuracy and speed of distributing timezone data to ensure clients are kept up to date with sometimes rapidly changing definitions. It also allows clients to avoid having a complete database of all timezones - instead they can download timezone data on a case-by-case basis. (Reference draft-douglass-timezone-service.)</p>

<h5 id="transparency">Transparency</h5>
<p>A property of an event that defines whether it will appear free or busy in free/busy time searches.</p>

<h5 id="utc">UTC (Coordinated Universal Time)</h5>
<p>UTC is designated to be at zero longitude. Also known as Zulu Time (NATO/military designation). Formerly GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) although there is a slight difference. UTC is the basis for all local time offsets. Offsets are either positive or negative. An example is UTC-8 (Pacific Standard Time). Some iCalendar examples:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>DTSTART:19970714T133000 ;Local time
DTSTART:19970714T173000Z ;UTC time
DTSTART;TZID=US-Eastern:19970714T133000 ;Local time and time zone reference
</code></pre>
</div>

<h5 id="valarm">VALARM</h5>
<p>A VALARM calendar component is a grouping of component properties that is a reminder or alarm for an event or a to-do. For example, it may be used to define a reminder for a pending event or an overdue to-do. VALARMs will thus be included within VEVENT and VTODO components. VAVAILABILITY - An iCalendar component that is used to describe periods of time for which a calendar user is available for scheduling of events. (Reference: draft-daboo-calendar-availability.)</p>

<h5 id="vcalendar">vCalendar</h5>
<p>A text representation of calendar and scheduling data created by the Versit consortium (also, the vCalendar specification). The RFC5545 iCalendar specification supersedes the work of vCalendar, though VCALENDAR remains as a component type in the RFC5545 iCalendar specification.</p>

<h5 id="vcard">vCard</h5>
